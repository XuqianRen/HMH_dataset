# A Generative Adversarial Framework for Optimizing Image Matting and Harmonization Simultaneously

## Introduction

In this repository, we release our dataset and the codes for the dataset generating pipeline.

We generate our training dataset based on a public dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/laurentmih/aisegmentcom-matting-human-datasets. 

Our generated HMH dataset can be downloaded from
